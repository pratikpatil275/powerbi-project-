Project Title: Population Analysis Dashboard

Objective:
The aim of this project was to analyze population data, specifically focusing on demographics such as age, gender, and geographic distribution. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize and extract meaningful insights from the provided CSV dataset.

Methodology:

Data Import and Cleaning:

Imported the population data from a CSV file into Power BI.
Utilized Excel for data cleaning, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Data Exploration and Transformation:

Created measures and applied formulas to calculate key metrics.
Developed categories based on age groups to facilitate detailed analysis.
Dashboard Components:

Total Population by Age Group:
Visualized the distribution of the population across different age groups using a bar chart.
Population of Male and Female by Age Category:
Implemented a clustered column chart to represent the gender distribution within each age group.
Total Male-Female Population:
Utilized a Donut chart to illustrate the overall composition of the population by gender.
Top 5 Age Groups in Population:
Presented a area chart highlighting the age groups with the highest populations.
Geographic Analysis:

Identified countries with the highest populations, specifically highlighting Bolivia and Georgia.


Implemented filters to allow users to explore data dynamically.
Users can filter data based on age category

Key Insights:
Age group 0 to 19 exhibits a significantly high population.
Bolivia and Georgia stand out as countries with notable population figures.
The senior age category demonstrates a higher population count compared to other age groups.
Conclusion:
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive and visually appealing exploration of population data. The interactive features empower users to gain valuable insights into demographic patterns, facilitating informed decision-making based on the presented data.
